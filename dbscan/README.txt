Instructions for running: Project2: Third algorithm - DBSCAN 


------------------------------------------------------------
1.To run the application in terminal, navigate to folder containing the python files and run directly the following command:
>> python dbscan.py

2. The default dataset is 'cho.txt'.

	- to alternate dataset, you can set manually in 'dbscan.py'


3. The parameters used in DBSCAN algorithm are pre-determined using 'params.py'.

	- The pre-determined parameters for the three datasets, 'cho', 'iyer', 'new_dataset_1', are already recorded in 'dbscan.py'. (line 90)
	- When alternating dataset(line 75-77 in dbscan.py), you can change the parameters according to the instruction in the comment in 'dbscan.py'.( line 90)


5.There's no need to open the 'params.py' file if you just want to run the DBSCAN algorithm on the three datasets.
